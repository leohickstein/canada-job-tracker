# ðŸ”’ Security Fix Applied

## Issue
The `.env.local` file containing sensitive credentials was accidentally tracked by Git.

## Actions Taken

âœ… **Removed from Git tracking**: `git rm --cached website-react/.env.local`  
âœ… **Updated .gitignore**: Added comprehensive environment file patterns  
âœ… **Created .env.example**: Template for other developers  
âœ… **Verified commit history**: Limited exposure in recent WIP commits  

## What You Should Do

### 1. **Immediate Actions (Recommended)**
Since your credentials were in Git history, consider rotating them:

- **Supabase**: Go to Settings â†’ API â†’ Reset anon key if you're concerned
- **Adzuna**: Generate new API keys if needed

### 2. **For Team Members**
If you share this repo, team members should:

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp website-react/.env.example website-react/.env.local

# Fill in their own credentials
# Edit .env.local with real values
```

### 3. **Going Forward**
- `.env.local` is now properly ignored by Git
- Only `.env.example` (with placeholder values) is tracked
- Real credentials stay local and secure

## Note
The credential exposure was minimal (recent WIP commits only), but rotating keys is good security practice when credentials have been in version control.
